Through a meticulous analysis of the data, a clear and compelling picture of the primary causes of accidents in New York City emerges. Unsafe driving behavior seems to be at the forefront of these causes, with a focus on issues such as inattention, following too closely, and failure to yield the right-of-way. These findings are not only enlightening, but also serve as a call to action for policymakers and individuals alike to take a more proactive role in promoting safe driving practices on the city's busy roadways.

This indicated that these crashes are mostly caused by human errors, and not by difficult weather conditions or time. These causes are typical and are in no way a revelation, as they are also the top reasons that people crash in the rest of the world.

The fast-paced and constantly active and changing environment of New York City can easily cause drivers inattention and distraction. With so much going on around them, drivers may become easily distracted by their surroundings, including billboards, pedestrians, and other vehicles. Additionally, the sheer volume of vehicles on the city's roads can make it difficult for drivers to navigate intersections and properly yield to other vehicles and pedestrians, resulting in failure to yield the right-of-way.
The many potholes and uneven surfaces on New York City roads can cause excessive wear and tear on tires, leading to tire failures and other problems. With congested roads and heavy traffic, drivers may feel pressure to follow closely behind the vehicle in front of them in order to maintain their position on the road, resulting in following too closely. In an effort to save time and avoid congestion, drivers may attempt to pass other vehicles or change lanes improperly, leading to improper passing and lane usage.
Parking in New York City can be challenging, leading drivers to back up and maneuver their vehicles in tight spaces. This can increase the risk of accidents and collisions with other vehicles and pedestrians, resulting in backing unsafely. With so many different types of traffic control devices, such as stop signs, traffic lights, and speed limits, drivers may become confused or disregard them altogether, resulting in traffic control disregarded.
