Through a meticulous analysis of the data, a clear and compelling picture of the primary causes of accidents in New York City emerges. Unsafe driving behavior seems to be at the forefront of these causes, with a focus on issues such as inattention, following too closely, and failure to yield the right-of-way. These findings are not only enlightening, but also serve as a call to action for policymakers and individuals alike to take a more proactive role in promoting safe driving practices on the city's busy roadways.

This indicated that these crashes are mostly caused by human errors, and not by difficult weather conditions or time. These causes are typical and are in no way a revelation, as they are also the top reasons that people crash in the rest of the world.

The fast-paced and constantly active and changing environment of New York City can easily cause drivers inattention and distraction. With so much going on around them, drivers may become easily distracted by their surroundings, including billboards, pedestrians, and other vehicles. Additionally, the sheer volume of vehicles on the city's roads can make it difficult for drivers to navigate intersections and properly yield to other vehicles and pedestrians, resulting in failure to yield the right-of-way.
The many potholes and uneven surfaces on New York City roads can cause excessive wear and tear on tires, leading to tire failures and other problems. With congested roads and heavy traffic, drivers may feel pressure to follow closely behind the vehicle in front of them in order to maintain their position on the road, resulting in following too closely. In an effort to save time and avoid congestion, drivers may attempt to pass other vehicles or change lanes improperly, leading to improper passing and lane usage.
Parking in New York City can be challenging, leading drivers to back up and maneuver their vehicles in tight spaces. This can increase the risk of accidents and collisions with other vehicles and pedestrians, resulting in backing unsafely. With so many different types of traffic control devices, such as stop signs, traffic lights, and speed limits, drivers may become confused or disregard them altogether, resulting in traffic control disregarded.

Which brings us to the vehicles involved in the accidents. Since NYC is a megacity, it has to accommodate all types of commuters be it pedestrian cyclist or motorized commuters. In the limited space provided by this large city with over 8.3 million inhabitants it can sometimes be a bit tricky to design an infrastructure with designated lanes for all the different types of commuters.

Letâ€™s look at  cyclists for instance. Casey Neistat a youtuber from NYC has presented a nice clip about the life as a green commuter on a bicycle in NY: 

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bzE-IMaegzQ?start=70" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>

This clearly shows the cities compact and complex structure and the difficulty of accommodating the famous yellow cabs, busses, cars, bikers, and pedestrians in this megacity. Delving deeper into the data, we find that the statistics paint a vivid picture of the dominant role played by light vehicles in accidents. This may come as no surprise, given their popularity on the roads, but the sheer scale of their involvement is staggering. However, when we take a closer look at the involvement of other vehicle types, a remarkable trend emerges: the numbers are strikingly similar across the board. In other words, it's only the light vehicles that stand out, like a flashy sports car on a dusty country road. So, while it's true that these vehicles are the most commonly sold, it's clear that they're also the most frequently involved in accidents, leaving other vehicle types trailing in their wake.

With the increasing trend in Vehicle marked it could be interesting to see the involvement of Heavy vehicles as more and more people are drifting towards bigger cars. As we witness a growing trend towards larger vehicles in recent years, it's natural to wonder about the impact this has had on accident statistics, particularly when it comes to the involvement of heavy vehicles. With SUVs and trucks becoming ever more popular, it stands to reason that they may be playing an increasingly significant role in crashes. Indeed, it's fascinating to contemplate just how this shift in consumer preferences might be shaping the safety landscape, and what implications it could have for the future of transportation.

As the second plot shows the trend towards larger vehicles does not seem to have had a significant impact on the number of traffic crashes in New York City, at least based on the data we have available. However, what is striking is the increasing number of bikes, scooters, and mopeds on our streets, which suggests that many people are embracing the greener commuting options that have become more widely available in recent years. This is an exciting development, as it not only speaks to our growing awareness of environmental issues, but also suggests that our city's transportation infrastructure is evolving to better accommodate a range of transportation choices.
As we saw earlier in this section, an 11-year-old video highlighted the many challenges that bikers in NYC faced at that time, from blocked bike lanes to drivers who failed to yield to cyclists. However, in the years since that video was filmed, it suggests that there have been significant efforts to improve the safety and accessibility of the cities bike infrastructure, and a growing awareness among drivers of the need to share the road with cyclists and other non-motorized vehicles. All of this suggests that New York City may be becoming a more bike-friendly city, and that it is becoming a more sustainable and equitable transportation system. 

Nonetheless, with more Bikers, scooters and mopeds also comes more severe injuries as the driver is not encapsulated in 10 cm walls of steel with a great number of airbags. When looking at the numbers however it seems as though it is the opposite case.

When comparing the number of injuries it seems, cyclists have the lowest incidence of injuries in traffic, despite the common notion that cycling is a high-risk activity. Surprisingly, motorists had the highest number of injuries, while pedestrians suffered twice the number of injuries as cyclists. This observation may be attributed to the elevated velocity at which motorized vehicles often travel. Now the Casualties, are expected to follow a similar path, however there is a quite interesting observation to be made.

Despite the lower number of cyclist fatalities in traffic compared to motorized vehicles, the number of casualties among pedestrians is significantly higher than that of cyclists, and even surpasses the number of casualties among motorists. This is not surprising, as motorists are protected by a sturdy vehicle and safety features, while pedestrians are vulnerable to the reckless actions of drivers. However interestingly, the pattern of casualties differs from that of injuries, indicating a complex relationship between the mode of transportation and the severity of the accident. It seems that the number of casualties of pedestrians and motorists behaves like complete opposites, which was not the case when looking at the injuries.  
The trends seem to shift towards more casualties as a motorist as opposed to pedestrians which could be due to several reasons. One possibility is that the city has implemented several safety measures to make the streets safer for pedestrians, such as the installation of pedestrian countdown signals and the redesign of dangerous intersections. Additionally, there may be an increase in the number of people using cars and other motor vehicles, leading to more motorist casualties. Whether the streets of New York have been getting safer however can be seen in the next graphic, which shows to zip areas with the most accidents in red and the least in green.

Through the span of 2013 till 2022, there has been a notable decline in the frequency of traffic accidents in New York City, and the data visualization of the map reflects this positive trend with a noticeable shift towards a greener hue. However, the geographical distribution of accidents seems to have remained consistent, in the East New York neighborhood in Brooklyn continuing to be the area with the most crashes. On the other hand, Manhattan's accident frequency has shown a remarkable decrease, with the map depicting a transition from a dark orange to a rich green shade, indicating a significant reduction in crashes in recent years.

Another interesting trend is the time of the crashes.

An intriguing observation from the two years is the consistency in the time of day when the incidents occur. It seems that most crashes occur the commute times to and from work, and rapidly decline after. Nevertheless, the striking finding is the significant decrease in the number of crashes, which is a staggering one third reduction. This is a remarkable feat and a testament to the effectiveness of modern safety features implemented in vehicles. Technologies such as lane assist and radar cruise control may have played a vital role in this positive trend, helping drivers stay centered and maintain a safe distance from the cars in front while navigating through traffic.
