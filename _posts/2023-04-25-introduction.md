-----------------------------------------------

New York City, the metropolis that never sleeps, is home to a staggering 8.3 million people and is one of the most densely trafficked cities in the world. With over 1.9 million crashes recorded in the last decade, it's no secret that navigating the city's streets can be a daunting and sometimes dangerous experience. These crashes involve a wide range of vehicles and are caused by countless number of factors, from reckless driving to inclement weather conditions. However, while the exact reasons behind each crash may be difficult to discern, analyzing the trends and patterns in the data can provide valuable insights into the overall safety of New York City's roadways.
In this report, we will dive deeper into the data and explore things such as which vehicles are most commonly involved in accidents, identify the primary reasons behind these crashes, and track how these trends have progressed over the years. We will also examine whether the number of incidents has decreased or increased over time and provide possible explanations for these findings. Through the use of visually stunning graphs and maps, we will paint a vivid picture of the traffic safety landscape in New York City, offering both professionals and a casual reader like you and me a comprehensive and engaging view of the city's traffic safety situation.

The dataset used for this report is found on the NYC OpenData web page and can be found through this link https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/Motor-Vehicle-Collisions-Crashes/h9gi-nx95.  

This comprehensive dataset captures a wealth of information, including the precise location, crash time and date, and types of vehicles involved in each incident. In cases where multiple vehicles were involved, the dataset accounts for up to 5 unique vehicle types. Additionally, the dataset meticulously documents the number of individuals injured or killed in each crash, categorizing them according to whether they were pedestrians, motorists, or cyclists.
While the dataset provides valuable insights into the occurrences of crashes in New York City, it is worth noting that there are instances where the reason for the crash remains unspecified. This observation underscores the complexity of road safety, and the role that environmental factors such as weather and time of day can play in contributing to incidents on the road. Despite these limitations, the dataset serves as an tool for studying trends and patterns related to traffic safety in one of the world's most dynamic and bustling cities.
