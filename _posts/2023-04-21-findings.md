 A comprehensive analysis of New York City traffic behavior was conducted with the aim of determining whether the city's traffic has become safer over time. The analysis was based on a thorough examination of various aspects of the data.

The results of the analysis suggest that New York City's traffic is indeed becoming safer with each passing day. The implementation of advanced technology, such as collision avoidance systems, has helped to significantly reduce the number of accidents caused by human error. While autonomous driving is still in its early stages, it holds the potential to virtually eliminate the impact of human error on road safety.
However, it is important to note that human error will continue to be a factor until autonomous driving becomes implemented to a greater extend. The analysis reveals that driver behavior, such as speeding, and distracted driving are still significant contributors to accidents on New York City roads. Therefore, it is essential to continue implementing and improving upon technological advancements that aid drivers in becoming safer on the roads.
Another key finding of the analysis is that the death rates for pedestrians are decreasing. This is an important metric as pedestrian safety is a major concern in any urban area. The report suggests that the implementation of pedestrian safety measures, such as crosswalks, traffic lights, and pedestrian islands, have played a significant role in reducing pedestrian fatalities.
In conclusion, this report demonstrates that New York City's traffic is on the right path towards becoming safer with each passing day. While human error continues to be a factor, the implementation of advanced technology and safety measures has helped to significantly reduce the number of accidents and fatalities. As technology continues to improve, it is inevitable that crash numbers will decrease even further, making New York City's roads safer for all.
